# AlG-100-Final-Exam
### Writing a clean, and secure code is must for any software engeneer

# C files compilation:
### Open any terminal:  ``` gcc filename.c``` or ``` gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror filename.c```

# Python file execution:
### Using your terminal: ``` python3 filename.py```

# Exam Questions:
## Exercise 1:
### 1. Implement the Binary Search algorithm. Assume the array is sorted.
### 2. Implement the Insertion Sort algorithm. This algorithm traverses the list, and for each element, inserts it into the sorted portion of the list.
### 3. Implement the merge sort algorithm. This algorithm divides the list into two, recursively sorts each sublist, and then merges the two sorted sublists.

## Exercise 2:
### Write a program that reads two arrays A and B and their dimensions N and M from the keyboard
and adds the elements of B to the end of A. Use the pointer formalism whenever possible.
## Exercise 3:
Write a C program that calculates the length of a string using a pointer.
